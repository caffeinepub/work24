  "summary": "The diff implements client-side JSON parsing and a per-row Formatted/Raw toggle for Admin messages, rendering recognized fields with labels and an “Other fields” section, plus i18n keys for the new UI. One notable gap is the explicit surfacing of image/file counts as dedicated fields; the formatter currently only shows array lengths generically if the underlying JSON keys appear under “Other fields”. Additionally, unrelated auth/provider changes appear to have been made outside the requested scope and against the stated immutable-path constraint.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "In the formatted Admin message view, surface commonly useful fields (when present) as dedicated, clearly labeled rows/sections including image/file counts.",
      "reason": "The formatter’s recognized field list does not include any image/file count keys, so image/file counts will not be surfaced as dedicated labeled fields; they would only appear as generic entries under “Other fields” (if present) with a value like “N items”.",
