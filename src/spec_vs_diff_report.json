  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements. REQ-1 is fully implemented by removing the ActivityFeed component from HomeServices.tsx. REQ-2 is implemented through changes to MessagesTab.tsx that fetch all messages via useGetAllMessages hook, sort by timestamp descending, and render using AdminMessageRenderer. REQ-3 is implemented via the backend getAllMessages function that returns all messages without filtering. No missing requirements were identified. One hallucinated feature (migration module) was added that was not requested.",

      "description": "Migration module (backend/migration.mo) was added to handle state migration, preserving nextMessageId and removing ADMIN_USERNAME/ADMIN_PASSWORD fields",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly listed 'Do not modify the AdminMessageRenderer component logic' as a constraint but did not request any migration logic or state schema changes. The migration.mo file and its integration into main.mo were not part of the requested requirements.",
