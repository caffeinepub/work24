# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add worker attribution tracking and organize admin panel data into separate tabs for materials, services, and messages.

**Planned changes:**
- Store worker name and ID with each material submission
- Store worker name and ID with each service/worker profile submission
- Display worker attribution (name and ID) in admin panel for materials
- Display worker attribution (name and ID) in admin panel for services
- Organize admin panel into three separate tabs: Materials, Services, and Messages
- Ensure active tab is visually indicated and data persists when switching tabs

**User-visible outcome:** The website owner can view all submissions organized in tabs and see which worker posted each material or service, making it easy to contact the right worker when buyers inquire.
